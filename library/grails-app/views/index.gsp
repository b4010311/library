<h3>Welcome to The University Enrolement and Library System</h3>
<p>Welcome to the University Enrolement and Library Booking System, from this you will be able to add courses and students and enroll them onto a course. You will also be able to add any new Libraries and librarians and books that are associated with that library. You can also give out a book to a student and record the details of when it was borrowed and when it is to be returned. </p>
